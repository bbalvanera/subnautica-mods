# Mark As Read

I was tired of the notification badge showing in the PDA for every new entry. With this mod, I'm able to get rid of such notifications with a simple mouse click

# BulkCraft

Since the main character is always so hungry, I used to cook large amounts of Peepers at a time and it was too time time consuming to click once for every fish, specially after getting many out of the ACU. With this mod, I'm able to craft in bulk all fishes and in my inventory and, indeed, all other recipes for which I have material on hand, all in bulk.
